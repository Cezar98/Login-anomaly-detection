# Login-anomaly-detection
A simple project example of creating a model which detects login anomalies  It uses a toy example as table.
We read the data sample_logins.csv in the Current Working Directory.

The results give high precision (most of detected anomalies are actually anomalies), but small recall (many anomalies however go unnoticed). So, the F-score is also small.


Works on Python 3.10
